# Neural Networks for Machine Learning 
University of Toronto

## About this Course
Learn about artificial neural networks and how they're being used for machine learning, as applied to speech and object recognition, image segmentation, modeling language and human motion, etc. We'll emphasize both the basic algorithms and the practical tricks needed to get them to work well.

This course contains the same content presented on Coursera beginning in 2013. It is not a continuation or update of the original course. It has been adapted for the new platform. 

Please be advised that the course is suited for an intermediate level learner - comfortable with calculus and with experience programming (Python).
